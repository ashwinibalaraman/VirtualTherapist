<b>DR:</b> So you donating blood?  As a test?
<b>PT:</b> No, I went to get a blood test at [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office for [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and the nurse blew it, oh when she let that needle roll.
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s nurse.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] must not do it, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is someone that's a neurologist -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Looking at one of my legs, they're so weak on me.
<b>DR:</b> He's wanting some blood work done?
<b>PT:</b> He wanted some blood work done and I said well I'll go back to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and his nurse she pulled out the, the tube and for some reason that thing rolled and I thought I was going to pass out doctor.  [LAUGHING].  You know, you can take a blood test if nothing goes wrong.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Otherwise needle rolling in your arm is not a good feeling.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> And I said "Don't worry, I'm not going to pass out" I'm glad [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that's still nauseating.  [LAUGHING].  Shouldn't have done that, it's going to black and blue like I been shooting up for days.
<b>DR:</b> So you go back to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] then?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I go back to see him in [INAUDIBLE] months but first I got to have an MRI.
<b>DR:</b> For the knees?
<b>PT:</b> No, for, he says it's my neck, I said, "Doctor, curse my neck it's not what's bothering, it's my legs," he said "Trust me, it's your neck" so I'm getting an MRI.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To see if the bone or what's behind your spinal cord was closing in on my neck because my neck's to be so weak.
<b>DR:</b> You don't want to hear that.
<b>PT:</b> No I don't want to hear that and then, I told him I said, "All my family always had problems with their legs," mine are just, I've got a bigger problem I live on the second floor.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Yep, I never understand what I'm doing I'm not going to be able to climb those stairs much longer.  Sad.
<b>DR:</b> How's your health been otherwise?
<b>PT:</b> Well think I've been doing good.
<b>DR:</b> Blood pressure been all right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] released me to all of those [INAUDIBLE] so I don't have to go back to see him ever.
<b>DR:</b> Ever?
<b>PT:</b> No for all this to and um, he sent me back to see the neurologist, I had seen him before and he said, you know, you got some damage in your legs but this time was the one that when I told him it was getting worse that I'm having to hold on to the railing just to get up the steps doctor, if I didn't have my arms I wouldn't get up the steps.
<b>DR:</b> No that's not good.
<b>PT:</b> And so that's what he's come up with, it could be damage to the spinal cord which I told him I mean I'm going to have to sell the condo but I'm hoping the way to the market comes back some.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Get me a ground floor unit.
<b>DR:</b> How are you spending your days and you're reading obviously.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I'm reading, I'm standing a recluse, I can't stand people anymore doctor, I don't even try, don't want to try.
<b>DR:</b> Not even with the -
<b>PT:</b> I've come to the conclusion I don't like people [PHYSICIAN NAME] and I don't see any effort put forth for my effort.
<b>DR:</b> Not even your neighbors anymore, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I come to the conclusion I don't know if you've been in the south all your life [PHYSICIAN NAME], but you know what trash is?
<b>DR:</b> I've heard the expression.
<b>PT:</b> My neighbor's trash, both of them.  They come from up north, they have absolutely no raising, no manners, they only think about themselves, they are no benefit to society whatsoever.  On their thing is what's the next deal and how am I going to benefit from it.
<b>DR:</b> They're retired or?
<b>PT:</b> One of them is retired the other one is still working um, she's going to back to school because she never finished high school so now she's going back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and she butters up all her teachers but she's found one black teacher she can't butter up and she figures it's because the black teacher is prejudice against white students that do good and I'm saying, I told her [PHYSICIAN NAME], I told her son this, "You can't butter up every teacher."
<b>DR:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>PT:</b> "Not everybody is your cup of forte, you buttered up all the rest of them but you can't butter this one up."
<b>DR:</b> So you're spending some time with this one, you're talking to her some?
<b>PT:</b> I talked to her Sunday but I don't want to talk to her anymore, I don't want to talk and the one next door to them I could walk all over her and never speak to her again.  She, what a crook, she'd cheat her own mother out of her last dime.  Now I didn't like my mama, [INAUDIBLE], didn't like her at all but I'd never take her livelihood away from her.  I was never that gouging for money.  I, and she's been trying to declare her mother incompetent for three months now so she can get her hands her mothers got, $8000 she wants to get her hands on that $8000 and she has fought with the state of Massachusetts right and left trying to get her mother declared incompetent.  Well the state says without a doctor to declare her incompetent she's not incompetent.  But, so she was drawing up this document the other day and she called me in there to read it and I said, "You don't think that's legal do you?"  She said, "You don't think so?"  I said, "Of course not, it's just something you're writing up."  So, you got to go to an attorney and have it drawn up.  Well listen, I said, "It won't protect you at all."  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I think that's stopped her from trying to go after her mother that way.  [LAUGHING].  She was going to take all of her mother's money away from her and pretend that she was going to pay her mother's bills before she would leave her mother on welfare.  [INAUDIBLE] anything.  But she's pure trash, doctor, I heard it all along, so I know what it is now.  I seen some people that have no concept that there's something beyond their little world.  You know there's a main [INAUDIBLE] got a higher calling than gouging or that's what my mother's told me over the years.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Well what was your experience all the years in the banking industry?
<b>PT:</b> They gouge you for the last penny you have.
<b>DR:</b> You got different perspective on that industry since you've been away from it?
<b>PT:</b> No, it's gotten worse now, all bankers are crooks, we know what they've put the economy into it, crash.  It's just what I was experiencing on a bigger scale because the New York banks were doing it and they had a lot worse ability to spread beyond.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Bankers are crooks.
<b>DR:</b> How are you doing with your retirement?  Things pretty stable?  Are you secure?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I start drawing my pension in July, it starts appearing in July.  The contract runs out in June so, I turn [AGE] so I start drawing, I'll draw approximately double what I'm drawing on my contract.
<b>DR:</b> What's your contract?  What's that?
<b>PT:</b> My contract is uh, my [INAUDIBLE] severance contract they had to pay to get me to leave quietly without suing them but now I'll be drawing my pension plus my Social Security which will double what my contract was, which I should be doing fine.
<b>DR:</b> Because you're doing fine now with half of it.
<b>PT:</b> You know what half because I don't have any, I don't dress fancy, I have an old beat up car which I love don't want to ever get rid of.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That's something.
<b>PT:</b> Have my cats and me, my condo's paid for, I don't have extravagant needs doctor.
<b>DR:</b> So you're saving money.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I really don't have, I guess if I had something I really but I don't need anything, the wor, the thing that I buy the most of is books.  [LAUGHING].  Buy me some jeans from LL Bean every now and then, you know what I'm saying.  I want a new pair of jeans I go to LL Bean.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> You don't save all your old books, do you?
<b>PT:</b> No I take them to the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I took them, my hardbacks the last time and the [DEIDENTIFIED] told me they didn't take hardbacks anymore and I said, "Well, what am I supposed to do with them?"  This woman says, "Well I donate them to this animal shelter and they sell them," I said, "Well, I'll give you these hardbacks and I'll keep bringing the hardbacks to you," and I'll give [DEIDENTIFIED] my paperbacks and they said, "All right."  So that's what I've been doing.  But I got a whole bag of them and my junk room is filled with books and I just take a box a week because she works on Tuesdays.
<b>DR:</b> To the [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> To the [DEIDENTIFIED] and she trades my hardbacks to the cat, to the animal shelter were they, they sell them or whatever they do to get the money for the animals, you know.
<b>DR:</b> That's a nice idea, I got some books I need to get rid of.
<b>PT:</b> Animal shelter will take the them, but the [DEIDENTIFIED] won't take hardbacks anymore, I thought that was, I said, said, "My [INAUDIBLE] would like hardbacks better."
<b>DR:</b> I know I was just giving them to the library, that's what I've been doing.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum but you go into the library most of their stuff is all confused now, oh, I hadn't been in the library long time.
<b>DR:</b> I think they sell them too, they, the book sales and things and to get some money.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I seen, I've gotten book advertisements that they were selling books, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can go on, you can sell them on Amazon.
<b>PT:</b> That's true and the way I take care of my books I don't like to bend them up or anything.  [LAUGHING].  A book is a valuable thing to me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't know you get very much some books I see on there like a penny, you know.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I know, I buy my, I buy a lot of books from Amazon especially you know, some of my science fiction writers and my fantasy writers, especially you know, I've gotten into these uh, have you read anything by Ted Dekker?
<b>DR:</b> No, I don't think so.
<b>PT:</b> He writes some religious fantasy and it's pretty good.  Uh, he bit, he wrote this whole, I got the whole $3 choose three of them of a world he created in his head and it was fascinating and I got lost into that for at least six weeks it was three books together.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> It's some slow reading, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  The only thing that gets me side tracked is my TV sometimes and my Internet.
<b>DR:</b> Now I know you don't watch Fox news and CNN all day.
<b>PT:</b> I watch CNN at least three hours every evening though.
<b>DR:</b> That might uh, that might be making you kind of irritable too.
<b>PT:</b> It could be, because I have come to the conclusion that when the newspaper go out of print there will be nothing left of real reporting.  I keep my states sub, state paper subscription, do you know, it's gotten down to one section almost?
<b>DR:</b> That you can read.
<b>PT:</b> And there's nothing in the little section.
<b>DR:</b> Not much substance.
<b>PT:</b> No and I get so disappointed and I say I'm going to cancel this but then I says the alternative is CNN which they went from minute to minute and then no substance, they don't even do their own stories.  If it weren't for the newspapers, they'd have nothing to report.  Thank goodness for the New York Times and the Washington Post.
<b>DR:</b> You what, you read those online?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I think the state, the record they used to have here is probably the better paper anyway.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but I used to get both of them, I love my papers, I would sit there and go through the editorial, editorial page been knocked off of several days.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I like to read the editorial page, not to see what crazy people South Carolina talking about, this place is dead set republican, they going down the, bless you.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Our, our governor is leading the way, isn't he?
<b>PT:</b> The governor's going, taking us down.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> The town panic is under.
<b>DR:</b> Think our governor is something else.
<b>PT:</b> I tell you what, I have never seen anything so, we have been fighting over this stimulus money since the stimulus package was passed by Congress.  Our legislature is doing nothing, our governor is doing nothing, our states been standing still, our unemployment's third largest in the country, people have no jobs, they have no future, they have nothing and our governor standing up for his principle.
<b>DR:</b> Right, I'm sure that's what this is too, his principles, not his future.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he wants to run for President and does he not know that in the year what, 2008, this country gave the South a mandate, we don't want anymore of you white Republicans -
<b>DR:</b> From the South in particular.
<b>PT:</b> From the South and I don't think it went through his head for his head, 52% of the country voted against the Republicans, the biggest margin, margin or what the word is.  [LAUGHING].  In the longest time and the Republicans can't get the picture, let's just hit them over the head with a hammer, get their attention, doctor.  You've got to change.  There's people out there, Hispanics, black people, Indian Americans, there's a whole bunch of people beside white old people, which I'm a white old person but I'm not a Republican doctor.
<b>DR:</b> I know, you think.  Crime stinks, uh, when are you having your MRI done?
<b>PT:</b> [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so he's thinking you have spinal stenosis.
<b>PT:</b> Is that, what's that?
<b>DR:</b> That's the narrowing, spinal cord.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I told him I was not going to be sitting around in hovercraft, is that what you call those things that they're selling all the time on TV.  "You can get one with Medicare and your insurance company it'll be free to you" yeah, sure.  [LAUGHING].  You hadn't heard those people cheating people?
<b>DR:</b> Hm, I don't see much TV.
<b>PT:</b> Well don't as a doctor you don't need to see what they're doing to old people.  They're putting them in these mach, these chairs and you can maneuver, you can go through the Grand Canyon once you got one of them hover crafts.
<b>DR:</b> I'd stick within a wheelchair.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, one you got to roll and the other one you just hold on.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you don't sit in it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh you going to sit in it yeah -
<b>DR:</b> You do?
<b>PT:</b> And you probably never use your legs again once you start sitting in it.  [LAUGHING].  And I told, I said I'm not giving up my legs unless it comes down to the last disk it hurts.  I'll be hanging on as long as my arms got strength.
<b>DR:</b> How's your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Well I've been a little depressed lately, dealing with my crazy neighbors but once I figured out to stay away from them, there's been me and my babies.
<b>DR:</b> Well you're smart, you don't try to change them.
<b>PT:</b> No, you can't talk to people whose minds are closed.
<b>DR:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>PT:</b> You know it's like the one who was save the teachers out in the ghettos and I said, "Just keep buttering up everybody" [INAUDIBLE], she wouldn't listen and I said, "Shut up [NAME OTHER], it's none of your business, you went through all those years of school and you had never had to butter up her teacher."  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> And no bad thoughts?  About yourself anyway?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now are you getting anywhere, you, we had talked before about you doing some traveling.
<b>PT:</b> I don't think I want to travel anymore.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> I like being with myself with my children.
<b>DR:</b> You're not going out to dinner?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah I go out to dinner once a week, I'm going out to lunch today with [NAME OTHER], friend from the bank.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, good.
<b>PT:</b> And uh -
<b>DR:</b> Who also is retired now or not?
<b>PT:</b> She's still working.
<b>DR:</b> Still working.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I been exasperated with her because I expect her to see me at least once a month and she's always busy working, I wouldn't know about that myself.  [LAUGHING].  I did the same thing, she's a workaholic.
<b>DR:</b> And out to dinner how often?
<b>PT:</b> I go once a week, generally Saturday night [NAME OTHER] and I go out to dinner.
<b>DR:</b> That's the only time you get together?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  He's had, he's set in his way, I think he likes being by himself and he goes in his garden and he inundated me with zucchini and uh, squash.
<b>DR:</b> He's picking already, huh?
<b>PT:</b> He's picking them already and I said, "Well I'm going to make me some zucchini bread," boy did I, I made two of the best loaves of zucchini bread my first ch, try at it but I think I put a little bit extra sugar in it, [LAUGHING], it's so sweet, I said it will keep me going all day long with just one slice I don't need other food during the day.  [LAUGHING].  I said that's a little too much sugar and I think instead of 2 1/2 cups, I put 3 cups.  Sometimes I forget and use my glasses when I'm looking at my measuring.  I hadn't figured that out since my eyesight, I can't read small print and I should wear my glasses all the time but I take them off.
<b>DR:</b> You got plans for today?
<b>PT:</b> Well I got to finish this book because it's -
<b>DR:</b> Who wrote that one, Dean Koontz.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if you've read his other ones about Odd Thomas, this young man, he's about 20 now, he's written four other ones about Odd Thomas and Odd Thomas has disabilities, he sees dead people.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
