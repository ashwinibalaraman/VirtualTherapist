<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, how are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, I, um, talked to my sister, and she thinks I'm just lonely.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because, uh, I don't know if, uh, [NAME OTHER] is going to, you know, move down in October.
<b>DR:</b> Is she thinking about it or talking about it?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, she has to take care of her son, she said, and whether he can get on his own or not.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Would you like her to move back down, or not?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you'd have someone with you there, so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I understand.  Well, have you been talking to her pretty regularly, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And they've been get, have you and she been getting along pretty well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good because one of my memories is that when she was living down here, sometimes she could be pretty rough on you sometimes, is that -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Has that gotten better since she's moved down?
<b>PT:</b> I think so, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Well, I hope if she does move back that at least she'll be kind to you and -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And not be hard on you.  Okay.  So have you been getting together with any other people recently?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  Do you get together with them pretty regularly?  Or maybe -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  And at work, are you around other people, or are you pretty much by yourself?
<b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm pretty much by myself there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And, [PATIENT NAME], how many hours a week are you working now?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, 22 1/2.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how's work going?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.  Um, how have your spirits been holding up?  Have you been feeling happy, or sad, or somewhere in the middle?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, kind of, uh, um, sort of like I'm not sure of my purpose, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Purpose in life?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, that can be tough, [PATIENT NAME].  Sometimes -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard for us to know why, know what our life's purpose is.  I think sometimes we don't discover it right off the bat or even for many years sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Are there things that you look forward to doing each day, or each week?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, when you get together with [NAME OTHER], do you enjoy your time with him?
<b>PT:</b> To a certain extent, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are there any hobbies right now that you have or interests that you do in your spare time?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What do you do when you come home from work in the evening?
<b>PT:</b> Um, a lot of time I sleep in the afternoon.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes, sometimes I do work around the house.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, now you have kitties too don't you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How many?
<b>PT:</b> Four.
<b>DR:</b> Four.  Do you enjoy spending time with them?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Are they indoor kitties, or do they go outdoors?
<b>PT:</b> Indoor.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Around here that's probably best -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> There is so many wild animals.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you think that could be part of your purpose in life is to take care of them?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Um, are you sleeping okay at night?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty well.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how's your appetite been overall?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], do you ever weigh yourself to know how much you weigh?
<b>PT:</b> No, I probably weigh around 300 now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you remember when the last time was that you did check your weight?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think maybe about 3 months ago was 1, 290.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you figure you probably put on about 10 pounds since then?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, and, [PATIENT NAME], when you're at work are you able to concentrate and focus okay?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you been worry, worrying about things much, or not too much?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, you know, about the trial that's going to come up.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> When is that scheduled for again?
<b>PT:</b> Well, tomorrow is going to be another pretrial.  It was supposed to be the trial, but the detective, um, was, uh, on vacation, so, um, they wanted to put it ahead.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  So, you have a pretrial hearing tomorrow, and then the reschedule date for the trial?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Um, do you know if you're going to have to go back and testify or not, or if they're going to do a deposition here, or have you heard?
<b>PT:</b> Um, no, huh-uh, I haven't heard.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have, did the detectives call you and kind of keep you updated on what's happening?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, they're probably going to call my sister tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And tell them what happened at the pretrial.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Is there anything else that you're worrying about these days, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, you know, just if I'm going to have somebody nice to live with, and, uh, it's sort of hard for me getting chores done around the house.
<b>DR:</b> Is it because you don't have the energy or motivation or something else?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, maybe energy, motivation; I don't know.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, the outside lawn work.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  [COUGHING].  Excuse me.  [PATIENT NAME], do you feel sad much these days, or not too much?
<b>PT:</b> Um, some.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you feel happy more than sad, or sad more than happy?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'd say sad more than happy.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And do you think that sadness comes from being alone or do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, well I, I get bored.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, it sounds like you do end up spending a fair amount of time by yourself and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, okay.  What I'm thinking about, [PATIENT NAME], is the, the Paxil that you take -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That has benefits both for depression and anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And right now, you're on 40 mg, which is an average dose.  We can go up as high as 80, and 1 of the thoughts I'm having is, should we increase the dose a little bit to see if it would give you a little bit more support with the depression and maybe feeling, help you feel a little bit happier and not so sad.  How do you feel about that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I wonder if it might make me manic?
<b>DR:</b> Well, the Loxitane usually would help prevent that.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, so, it's not likely you would become manic.  I can't say 100% that you wouldn't.  That's always a risk with increasing an antidepressant.  But, um, our options would be to either leave it where it is or to try increasing the dose, or we could also add something else in if you wanted to, to try to boost it's effectiveness to help it be more effective.  That's another option.  If you feel like it's not helping enough.  Do you feel like your depression is reasonably well controlled most of the time, or do you feel like it's causing you some problems?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, did, did you see a lot of people today?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, a fair number, I guess.  Why do you ask?
<b>PT:</b> Because, um, you know, the skies are all cloudy and stuff outside.  It's kind of a dismal day.
<b>DR:</b> You're right.
<b>PT:</b> Were people kind of more down in the dumps sort of?
<b>DR:</b> Some people are more down on days like this.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And some aren't, it just depends.  Everybody's a little different.  Do you find yourself feeling more down on days where it's kind of gray like this?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, sort of.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So on days when it's a little sunnier, and a little nicer, you, that tends to lift your spirits?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well, [PATIENT NAME], if you decide you want to wait then and not change your medicine we could because, hopefully, these kind of days are coming to an end as the season gets warmer and warmer.
<b>PT:</b> Um, now, would I be increasing it like to 60 mg?
<b>DR:</b> That's usually the next step, if, if we decide to increase it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I mean, and I sure don't want things to get worse for you either, [PATIENT NAME], in terms of becoming more manic.  And again, I can't tell you for sure whether that would happen or not.  Hopefully it would not, but that's one of the risks that we have to be careful about.  If you want to wait another month or so and see how things go, we could, in the hope that some of this stress may pass with the trial.  Stress may pass, and also, if the weather gets a little bit warmer, that might help lift your spirits as well.
<b>PT:</b> Then I think, uh, I don't know why I haven't, maybe because I'm lazy, but I haven't been exercising like I should.  I take Thumper for a walk, but that's about it.  I should get on the bicycle and all because that, that releases endorphins doesn't it, in the brain?
<b>DR:</b> It does, you're right, [PATIENT NAME], it does, and it often lifts our spirits.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Again, if you want to try some things like exercise -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Wait for a little bit nicer weather and -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We can do, would you rather do that, do you think?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's fine.  Have you been having any thoughts of not wanting to live, or suicidal thoughts, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have them.
<b>DR:</b> Are they more passive thoughts, like if you'd get hit by a truck and could be way out of this, or are they thoughts of taking your own life?
<b>PT:</b> No, just passive.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  If those start to get stronger, will you let me know, so that we can do something about it because I don't want those thoughts to get any stronger?  Those are an indication of depression.  So, [PATIENT NAME], will you give me your word, you'll let me know of those get stronger?  Okay.  I just want to make sure that, that the depression doesn't get any worse because if it does, there are things we can do to help pull out of it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You don't have to struggle or suffer with it.  Um, okay, what about, have you had any problems with voices recently, hearing voices?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Or feeling unsafe at your home, or at work?
<b>PT:</b> Um, maybe feeling unsafe going to Ohio for that trial.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So worried about the people back there that -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Took advantage of you?  Okay.  That's understandable.  Okay.  Um, yes, it sounds like you're going through kind of a hard time now because of the trial, because of being alone.  A lot of things are kind of stressful and hard right now.  Not having a lot of people to do things with, or fun things to do.  Um, [PATIENT NAME], I think it's reasonable to give it another month, but, again, if you're not feeling better next month, let's not just, keep waiting.  Let's do something different to try and get you feeling better.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because I don't want you to feel more and more depressed either.  That doesn't help you at all, for sure.  Is there anything else going on that I haven't asked you about that you want to talk about?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well, I've been, uh, smoking pot on weekends, on Friday and Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> But I, but I don't do it during the week.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, just on Fridays and Saturdays, smoke pot?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, [PATIENT NAME], 1 thing to know about that is, unfortunately, the pot can interfere with the medicines -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And sometimes it can cause people to feel more depressed or even not have as clear of thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And it can even sometimes cause people to have suicidal thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> In some people.  Do you feel like you could give that up for a while, at least until the stress gets a little bit less in your life?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  That would be my suggestion to -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'm not asking you to quit forever, but for right now, when things are pretty, pretty hard, it might be good to stay away from the pot -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> To allow your brain chemistry to kind of balance out again -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And hopefully move, and come back up, and make it easier to cope with some of the hard stress you're going through.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did, you're not a big drinker of alcohol, are you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you drink any, or almost none?
<b>PT:</b> Um, very seldom.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  You're not using any other drugs besides the marijuana?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, the pot sometimes can help people feel better in the short run -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But in the long run som, unfortunately, it's a depressant on the brain because it depletes the brain of certain chemicals that regulate mood.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Like serotonin, and so, the medicines are trying to get those chemicals up, but the pot cause the chemicals to be released, and so the medicine doesn't work very well.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So if we remove the, the pot the Paxil will probably work better and we won't have to increase the dose.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, okay.  Well then, why don't we leave your medicine the way it is for now; give you a chance to, um, try exercise and giving up the pot; get through these great cloudy days.  Hopefully some warm weather is coming I think.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And check back in a month and see how you feel.  Does that sound okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Was there anything else you want to talk about before we set up another appointment, [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now, let's aim for about a month from now.  That's right towards the end of May, or first part of June.  And remind me; is there a day of the week that works best for you?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm just, uh, um, free, uh, in the afternoons.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And after what time about, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, oh, probably, uh, let's see, um, 2:30 and on.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, let's see here.  It looks like the first time that I would have that this would work for you would be, uh, Thursday [DATE] at 3:00.  Do you think that might work?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I' m sorry, you said 2:30 and on?
<b>PT:</b> Two thirty and on.
<b>DR:</b> Would you rather do 2:30 than 3:00 or -
<b>PT:</b> Either are okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well, we'll just do the, let me double check here.  And why don't we just do the 3:00.  Thursday, [DATE] at 3:00.  Okay, [PATIENT NAME], and there's the card.
<b>PT:</b> I sort of get depressed on, uh, weekends if nobody's around.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, it's hard when you're alone on the weekends, you know, again the things that might help, again, uh, even though I know the pot sometimes makes people feel better -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's why people smoke, to get high, but unfortunately, like I said, in the long run, it's a depressant on the brain and the nevous systems, so -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> If you give it up, you may, [COUGHING], excuse me, over time you may actually start feeling better, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then also you may be more able to get out and do something.  Maybe to be around people, go somewhere, do something, or exercise even, which would help with your mood more.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So what you could try this week is maybe do some exercise.  Do something you enjoy doing.  Going for a walk or biking or swimming or something like that that you would really enjoy, and that might help you feel better.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  So why don't you try that this month and, so if you feel any worse in the meantime, call me, but I'm hoping that we can get you feeling better this month.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right?  Okay, [PATIENT NAME], it's always good seeing you.
<b>PT:</b> You too, well, thank you doctor.
<b>DR:</b> You're welcome.  I'll look forward to seeing you next month -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And please call again, [PATIENT NAME], if you need anything before then.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thank you doctor.
<b>DR:</b> You're welcome.  See you later.
<b>PT:</b> Bye.
<b>DR:</b> Bye, bye.
