I THINK I KNOW a little about hell now. Hell is a lot of
things. Hell is the disintegration of a man&apos;s personality.
Hell is the distance between two people. Hell is turning
against the people you love. Hell makes a man cry when he
should be laughing, despise himself when he should be
respecting himself. Hell is wanting to kill yourself when
you have everything to live for. Hell is not being able to
function and living without hope that you&apos;ll ever again be
able to function. Hell is when memories that used to be
pleasant become painful, where anger and nausea come in
fits and starts and fear is a constant companion. Hell is
being locked up in a mental institution with a lot of little
men in white coats running around asking a lot of silly,
irrelevant questions.


Dr. MacLeod seemed rather puzzled when he found
me on the ninth floor the next day. I was sitting on the bed
watching a couple of sea gulls swoop over the Hudson
when he came in. It must have been apparent to him that
I was as sick, if not sicker, than I was when I first entered
the sanitarium.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What happened, Mr. Stefan?" he asked.


I shook my head. I wanted to say: "It&apos;s obvious, my
friend. You took me off the pills." But I said nothing. What
was the use? It made no difference.


"Did anyone say anything to upset you?"


Again I shook my head. He was determined, as usual,
to find a psychological reason for my relapse. It was a matter
of pride, perhaps; at least one rational reason ought to
be reported to his superiors.


"Try to reconstruct what happened yesterday," he
said.


Sure, think it out, the analysts say. Think it out and
there is a reason for this and for that and for that. Of
course. Think it out, and behind every reason there will
be another and another, so that there is no reason at all,
and then all you know is that you know nothing and
neither does anyone else.


"There are no reasons," I said. "There are no solutions.
There is only sickness."


"There must be a reason, Mr. Stefan."


"I wish you knew it," I said.


"Did you talk to your wife yesterday?"


"No."


I burst into tears. Christ, leave me alone! Stop torturing
me. Isn&apos;t the sickness bad enough? Don&apos;t talk to me
about Laurie. I don&apos;t want to talk about Laurie. I don&apos;t
want to talk about anything. Just leave me alone. Just
poison me. Just kill me.


I sat silently, sobbing now and then, while he badgered
me with his infernal questions, then finally I asked:

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You won&apos;t need a crutch, Mr. Stefan," he said, firmly.


He was true to his word. For the next week I was violent
and raging, and though I begged for the tofranil pills,
for some strange reason they wouldn&apos;t give them to me.
Again, perhaps, the theory was that I was supposed to get
worse before I got better. But hadn&apos;t I already been
through that? Hadn&apos;t I already gotten worse and hadn&apos;t
I, with the tofranil pills, gotten better? When I blew up and
screamed with agony, Dr. MacLeod would explain to me
that "these are very old emotions you are experiencing,
Mr. Stefan." The old line. They were bubbling up from
some unknown place in my subconscious after having been
repressed all these years. But why did they choose this year
to bubble up, a year that should have been one of the happiest
of my life? Why? Why? Why? I thought of Sartre&apos;s
classic play, "No Exit." The sanitarium was like that, only
worse. They don&apos;t employ psychoanalysts in Hell. But if I
were the Devil, and I wanted to modernize Hell, I&apos;d hire
a flock of analysts to grill and brainwash all of the inmates
into thinking that they aren&apos;t really being burned by fire
and brimstone. It&apos;s really all psychological. That burning
flesh you smell is really in your mind.


Laurie came, as she promised, the following weekend.
I didn&apos;t want her to come; I didn&apos;t want her to find me
back on the ninth floor, sicker than ever. MacLeod must
have told her that I had relapsed, for when she came, she
seemed pale and fragile and exhausted. Again she brought
flowers and while she was arranging them in a vase, I

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I&apos;m sorry, Laurie," I said.


"You didn&apos;t do anything," she said, still unable to
control her tears.


"Honey," I said, "you don&apos;t look good. Are you sick?"


She buried her face in her hands.


"What&apos;s the matter?" I asked. As if I, sick out of my
mind, could do anything when I couldn&apos;t even help myself.


She said that she hadn&apos;t been able to sleep recently,
that she stayed up all night worrying about me, that she
was terribly lonely, that sometimes she thought she would
lose control, that she needed someone to talk to, that she
had stopped seeing Dr. Eaton because we couldn&apos;t afford
it, that maybe she ought to see a psychiatrist and get some
tranquilizers....


All this went through me like a thunderbolt. I remembered
the dream I had had, about Laurie cracking
up and being committed.


"You&apos;re lying," I shouted, "you&apos;re not sick. No, you
can&apos;t be getting sick. You&apos;re just saying that. You&apos;re torturing
me. They sent you here to torture me. Please don&apos;t get
sick, Laurie. Oh Christ, it&apos;s my fault. Go away. Please don&apos;t
torture me any more. I can&apos;t take any more. I can&apos;t help
you. I&apos;m sick. Can&apos;t you see? Please tell me you&apos;re all right.
Please see a doctor. Get away. Get away. Oh my God!"


A couple of nurses and attendants, roused by my

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day Dr. MacLeod informed me that the
staff had decided that Laurie would not be allowed to visit
me for some time. I told him what she had told me, and
begged him to find a good psychiatrist for her, someone
who could help her. He promised that he would find a
reputable psychiatrist on the outside.


Before I was hospitalized I had read numerous psychiatric
theories about the cause of neuroses and psychoses.
The primary cause is lack of love in childhood, said one
analyst. No, said another analyst, it&apos;s caused by a weak
ego. You&apos;re wrong, said a third, it&apos;s an impairment of the
superego. Bosh, it&apos;s really an impairment of the id. You&apos;re
all wrong and you&apos;re all right, said still another, it&apos;s an impairment
of all three psychic levels. The collective subconscious
of the race has something to do with it, said
another. It&apos;s conflict between love and hate, intoned still

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was also a popular myth among the patients
(patients cling desperately to all sorts of myths) that the
more intelligent a patient was, the better his prognosis.
The psychoanalysts themselves believed this because,
after all, without intellect as a tool of treatment, they had
no business being there, and the patients believed it because
the vast majority were college graduates. Simple
observation, however, must have indicated to them that
the stupid patients, with virtually no insight into themselves
and who couldn&apos;t care less, got well and left early
very often, while the most brilliant patients stayed on perhaps
for years.


But it made no difference. The only thing that made
any difference, to me anyway, were the drugs. The chlorpromazine
quieted and stabilized me substantially and
allowed me to function well enough to learn to play chess.
But it wasn&apos;t a good game to learn because, in my sickness,
I started seeing the other patients as so many chess pieces
being moved places they didn&apos;t want to go by some invisible
hand. They actually started looking like pawns and
knights and bishops and rooks and kings and queens. Some
moved slowly, like pawns, a space at a time, only to find
their way blocked. Some slid along diagonally, like bishops,

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly, without giving me a reason, they took me
off the chlorpromazine. Within a day, I had sunk back into
a deep, agitated, non-functioning depression. When Dr.
MacLeod came to see me the next day, I didn&apos;t ask why I
had been taken off the chlorpromazine. I hadn&apos;t been told
why I was taken off the tofranil; I couldn&apos;t very well expect
to be told why the chlorpromazine was dropped. Besides,
something had happened to me. I was sicker than ever, but
now I was resigned. I was broken. I no longer cared. I no
longer had any fight left in me. The only interest I had was
in the gymnasium where, every day for an hour, I played
basketball furiously, hoping that a sudden heart attack
would end it all.


Dr. MacLeod informed me that Laurie was now seeing
a psychoanalyst by the name of Dr. Turko, who had
been formerly connected with the sanitarium and who, it
followed therefore, was quite reputable. I was assured
that Laurie was quite well now (which wasn&apos;t true) and
that I ought not to worry about her.


I sat in a stupor that was almost catatonic at our following
sessions, during which he continued to ply me with
questions about Laurie. One day, a couple of weeks before
Christmas, he asked me if I thought I would like to get
together with my wife and himself for a three-way talk.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No!" I said. "Keep her away from me. I don&apos;t want to
see her. Not like this."


Now Dr. MacLeod suddenly became more aggressive.
He was doing more and more of the talking. But I wasn&apos;t
listening. I was tired of all the talking. Tired of the psychoanalytical
tendency to suspect something rotten, some evil
selfish motive, behind every human thought, feeling or
endeavor.


"Are you sure that&apos;s the <i>real</i> reason, Mr. Stefan?" he
was saying. "Are you sure that&apos;s the <i>real</i> reason?"


But he wasn&apos;t getting through to me. Besides, what
difference would it make to me, or to Laurie? It was all
over anyway.


That night I took our wedding pictures off the dresser
and hid them away in a suitcase. For three months I had
carried them from one floor to another, and I&apos;d go to sleep
looking at them. Now it hurt too much to look at them.
Let one of the nurses put in her report that Laurie&apos;s pictures
had at last vanished from my dresser. I didn&apos;t give a
damn.


Next, Dr. MacLeod zeroed in on my parents. Who
were you closest to, your father or your mother? Did your
father punish you frequently? Did they suffocate you with
love?


I sat in a stupor and responded mechanically. Under
the doctor&apos;s questioning I began to remember unhappy
childhood scenes. I remembered my father, in a fit of temper
when I hadn&apos;t come to dinner punctually, smashing to
bits a model airplane I had built. I remembered my mother

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the nature of his questions, it seemed to me that
Dr. MacLeod was working on the theory that I had some
sort of Oedipus complex.


"I notice you are quite athletic," Dr. MacLeod said.
"And I understand that you used to participate in all kinds
of sports when you were a teenager. Have you ever thought
that it was probably your way--a constructive way--of
taking out your hostilities towards your father?"


Why couldn&apos;t this guy accept the simple fact that I
loved baseball, that I loved football and basketball and
tennis?


While I listened to MacLeod philosophizing, I often
wondered what Laurie was saying to Dr. Turko and what

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Isn&apos;t there anyone in the whole goddamn world that
will believe me when I cry out that my marriage had made
me the happiest man in the whole goddamn world? Isn&apos;t
there anyone in the whole goddamn world who will believe
me when I say that my marriage didn&apos;t cause my sickness
but it was my sickness that destroyed my marriage?


The snows fell and Christmas and the New Year came
and went scarcely noticed. I hadn&apos;t seen Laurie in weeks,
but she had written me, saying that since she couldn&apos;t see

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Since I was no longer violent, they had transferred me
off the ninth floor to a convalescent floor below. However,
I was now withdrawn and an even deeper depression had
set in. I had lost interest in everything. I could hardly
read a newspaper. I had forgotten about my cartoons. I
felt utterly defeated. Not an hour passed in which I didn&apos;t
contemplate suicide. Rarely did I talk to the other patients....
the other patients ... with their tortured faces
marked by the sickly yellow-green typical of schizophrenia.
How unbearable, how comprehensive their suffering!


A housewife, in her early forties, sitting by herself in
a corner, talking to imagined voices. Her hair, they said,
had turned white overnight when the illness came upon her.
A young man who had been studying for the priesthood,
stalking around the floor, cursing God. A prep school student
who fancied that he was Holden Caulfield and sat
around trying to remember all the great artists and writers
who had had nervous breakdowns. A Wall Street customer&apos;s
representative, for years an alcoholic, begging the
prep school student for some hair lotion. An epileptic Negro
youth with needle marks all over his right arm. A nymphomaniac
who kept trying to coax the alcoholic into a bathroom,
out of sight of the nurses. A doctor from Georgia
who had become a barbiturate addict. An editor of a
national magazine who drank himself into seeing pink
elephants because, when he didn&apos;t drink, he fancied people
were staring at him. A deeply depressed teacher who had
deliberately driven his car over a cliff and was even more

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The sanitarium had a few celebrities, too. I was so
withdrawn that I hadn&apos;t noticed the arrival of the rather
attractive blonde young lady in peppermint slacks. She
looked rather schoolmarmish, with her long hair set back
in a bun. She kept to herself, speaking to no one, her eyes
hidden behind a pair of large sunglasses. She rarely went
to dinner, and once when I asked her if she would join us
at dinner, she managed a smile but shook her head and
continued to gaze forlornly out the window. One evening,
a few days later, we heard her crying hysterically in her
room, then the sound of a mirror breaking into a thousand
pieces. A doctor and a couple of nurses came running, and
the young lady was escorted to the ninth floor. That was
the last we saw or heard of her. We had all been so sick
that we hadn&apos;t recognized her. It was Marilyn Monroe.


(When, barely two years later, I read of her suicide, I
was not surprised. I read with anguish the numerous nonsensical
theories and explanations of her illness and death
submitted by professional and amateur psychologists. Not
one of them suggested that she could have been physically
ill. Not one of them understood. But the patients at the
hospital would have understood, for they too, for years,
had vainly gone from psychiatrist to psychiatrist in search
of help. God bless you, Marilyn. We understood.)


And then there was Erskine. Erskine and I shared the
same room. A stocky man in his forties, he lived in a condition

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Erskine&apos;s girl friend, Violet, visited him punctually
twice a week. She&apos;d always bring him a puzzle, and the
two of them would sit at a table and work on it together.
"Violet&apos;s an alcoholic, too," he informed me. "Met her at
the A.A. Great gal. You know, she went to work and saved
up enough dough so as she could send me here. Don&apos;t
know what I&apos;d do without her."


I remember Erskine best because they decided to give

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was February. I had been there for five months; I
had been sick, in one degree or another, for over a year. I
was still very sick. I was not therefore surprised when Dr.
MacLeod one day recommended electric shock treatment.
I even asked for it. I was terrified of it, but I asked for it,
in the hope that it would either kill me or cure me. Would
it hurt? "No, Mr. Stefan, you won&apos;t feel a thing." What
does it do? "It causes a temporary loss of memory, but it&apos;s
only temporary." How many will I need? He hesitated.
"Perhaps twelve."


"Fine," I said, "it&apos;s better than having a hole drilled in
my skull. Lobotomy. Isn&apos;t that what you call it? But maybe
you can do that later. If the shock doesn&apos;t work."


"A lobotomy won&apos;t be necessary, Mr. Stefan," he said.
I remembered what he said five months ago, when I arrived:
"Shock treatment won&apos;t be necessary, Mr. Stefan."


Later I was to learn that psychiatrists don&apos;t have the
slightest idea as to how shock treatment works, what it
does, or why it works on some patients and not on others.
Some psychiatrists claim that it provides "a symbolic death
and rebirth." Others claim that the patient rather enjoys it
because it symbolizes punishment for all his guilt feelings.
Some physicians say it changes the physiology of the
brain cells. And some biochemists claim it changes the
chemistry of the body; there are, for instance, definite
changes in the level of calcium in the urine after shock.


Dr. William Sargant has suggested that electric shock
is an artificially induced epileptic fit. The patient&apos;s body

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But the prevailing opinion among the patients was
that shock treatment made you lose some nasty memories
by killing the culprit brain cells that made you remember
those nasty memories.


Erskine was terrified when he heard that they were
going to give him shock treatments. And so was his girl
Violet. The day before he was scheduled for his first one,
she visited him and held his hand for an hour, as though he
were about to walk his last mile. Afterwards, just before
she left, she took me aside and whispered anxiously: "Greg,
what does shock treatment do?"


"I don&apos;t know," I shrugged. "They say it kills some
brain cells."


"Gee," she said, sadly. "I hope they don&apos;t give Erskie
too many of them. He don&apos;t have many to spare."


Erskine was in and out of bed all night, nervously
chainsmoking cigarettes, pacing the corridor, awaiting the
moment of truth. I slept in fits and starts because I was
scared, too. So we talked; that is, Erskine talked mostly.
"You know, Stefan," he&apos;d say, "I was in the first wave at
Normandy and I didn&apos;t even bat an eye. Went right up
there and banged me a couple of Krauts. &apos;Course I was
scared, but not like this. Seems like I&apos;m scared of everything
now. Scared of things I shouldn&apos;t be scared of. Do
you suppose it&apos;ll hurt? I&apos;m glad you don&apos;t think so. You
ain&apos;t scared, are you? Don&apos;t bullshit me, you&apos;re scared.

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Erskine was white as a sheet when the attendants
came after him early in the morning. "Well, I&apos;ll see you,
kid," he said bravely, waving, and then suddenly he
stopped short, and turning green, ran to the bathroom. For
a long time we heard him retching.


A half an hour later they came after me. I went
quietly, like a man going to his electrocution. All I remember
is a small room and a couple of psychiatrists and two
nurses and an attendant, and everyone very grim about it
all, and somebody telling me to lie on a table, and then
someone painting some sticky cold jelly on my temples
and attaching cold electrodes to the spots, so I felt like
Frankenstein, and a nurse handing me an oxygen mask and
telling me to breathe deeply, and one of the attendants
holding onto my feet, and then a hand reaching down and
grabbing my jaw and pulling my head back, and seeing
the light on the ceiling and hoping that it&apos;d kill me quick
and wishing they&apos;d give me a chance to say goodbye to
Laurie and Dad and Mom...
