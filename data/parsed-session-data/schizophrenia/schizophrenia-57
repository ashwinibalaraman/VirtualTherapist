BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, how are you [PATIENT NAME]?  What's going on with the Invega?  You just told me what happened.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't have no - it didn't help me at all.
<b>DR:</b> In what way, like what, still hearing voices?
<b>PT:</b> I'm still hearing voices and I'm still forgetting things.  I forget - I forget my, you know, to do certain things and stuff like that, and I still have a little bit of problems sleeping.  Um, she'll get in my dreams and eventually it'll wake me.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> She likes to play with, with animals.
<b>DR:</b> Who?
<b>PT:</b> She likes to play, the lady that's following me around, she likes to play with animals.  She likes to kill animals.  Every time I, every time I drive, I come out, I see a dead squirrel or a dead dog or something, and she, she also mentioned that she was going to kill, she was going to kill my little puppy, and I really don't want that to happen.
<b>DR:</b> Now this lady, she has been following you ever since you were a child or? 
<b>PT:</b> Yes ever since I was a child, but it wasn't really bad when I was younger.  It's gotten worse.  It's gotten worse with my sleep, and all that.
<b>DR:</b> And Invega, when I gave you, what happened?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't have no changes.
<b>DR:</b> It did not go away at all, or it worked little bit and then it didn't?
<b>PT:</b> No, it didn't work at all.  I still had, had the lady annoying me, and uh, trying to destroy my life.  
<b>DR:</b> Is she trying to slow your car down?  Remember you told me?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor, my car won't go over, won't go over 50 miles an hour.  Feel it, feel her pulling, pulling on it.  I haven't been able to see her pull it, but I know it's her that's pulling on my car, and my car won't go any, any faster, and sometimes it would shake it and my car start to shake, shake like a, like a volcano erupting, and it could go on for miles at a time.  I'm scared that she'll break my car because she already broke a car that I had, and I think she might break another car again.  I think she might, I'm hoping not, but it's awful to drive a car when you feel like it's going to break down any second on you.  So.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you've been on Seroquel even when you moved from Florida, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.  The Seroquel has been the one that's been working the best for me, but with the raise in mg, I didn't have much changes 'cause I think I was taking 300, and then you raised it up to 400.
<b>DR:</b> You were taking 900 and I go - I went up to 8 - because remember they do not give you - the Medicare will not give you 300mg of 90 tablets, so I had to go to at least 400mg 2 at night.  So, you've been taking 800 now or no?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that's what I've been taking.
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking 2?
<b>PT:</b> Two.  
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on medicine called Risperidal?
<b>PT:</b> No, I never - I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on medicine called Haldol, old time medicine?
<b>PT:</b> No, I never heard of that.
<b>DR:</b> Or Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> You may have to because I think - so naturally you've been without Invega I just gave you last time 15 - uh, I gave you the samples, didn't I, the coupon?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I got -
<b>DR:</b> Did you use all of them?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I used all of them.
<b>DR:</b> And it didn't do anything, so you did not get more than 15 days, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> But while you were taking it, you didn't see much effect of it, did you?
<b>PT:</b> It didn't help me.
<b>DR:</b> What I'm going to do is continue with Seroquel because you've been using it for quite some time.  You've been using it long time.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> So, I don't want to change that at all.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to continue with that, but I'm going to add like some other antipsychotic, what we call it, it might be Haldol or Trilafon or something.  How hours you sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b> I , I sleep a regular 8 hours.
<b>DR:</b> You do?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And when you wake up in the morning, you wake up feeling refreshed or tired or what?
<b>PT:</b> I, I feel, I feel a little bit down sometimes, but it's not all that bad.
<b>DR:</b> So when you wake up, you wake up as if you slept?  It's not like oh I didn't sleep much?  It's a tired feeling or?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it's a tired feeling.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, you do.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Now, you're on Zoloft too, aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How long you been on Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b> Been on Zoloft ever since, uh, I started on Seroquel, which is back in '98.  I think one of my doctors had discontinued it one time, and I, my situation had gotten worse.  So, they put me back on the Zoloft, and that seemed to help a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I gave you Abilify and that did not work either, did it?
<b>PT:</b> It was about the same, doctor.  My situation was about the same with the Abilify.
<b>DR:</b> When you were given, like in 1998 when they gave you first time the medicines; have they been given Seroquel since then?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Did it stop that moment from doing what you was doing then or no?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it did help me quite a bit.
<b>DR:</b> When, in the beginning, Seroquel helped?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And then it quit?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.  It's still helping me, but I'm, I'm, it's not as, as regularly.  It's irregularly.
<b>DR:</b> Like when you were taking 900, it worked?
<b>PT:</b> It was helping me, I still had problems with voices and stuff like that, but -
<b>DR:</b> So what weight was helping you then?  What is the difference now that you are taking 800 as opposed to 900 when they were giving you in Florida when, before you moved here?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it was helping me, it was helping me to a certain control.  Um it, it had gotten worse.  Sometimes it, uh, sometimes it, you know, it, it helps, but to a certain extent where, you know, I could function a little bit better, and it doesn't cure me, it doesn't.
<b>DR:</b> Well I mean your condition, I want you to understand is controllable.  It's not curable.  It's a chemical imbalance.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> And you have a schizophrenic illness, and that fortunately you can control with the medication.  So you can live little decent life. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Your quality of life should be a little better than being controlled like with this woman and not being able to drive, the feeling that your car is shaking.  She's trying to give you signals that she's going to kill your puppy.  I mean those should be under control with Seroquel or the Invega that I gave you.
<b>PT:</b> They're, they're a big, under control, doctor.  I would say 'cause it was worse when I wasn't taking my medication.
<b>DR:</b> I know, but my question is that we, when you took 900 Seroquel, it was better controlled than 800, or can you tell, or not much difference?
<b>PT:</b> It's about the same, not much difference.
<b>DR:</b> So, it has been there then, right, in the beginning when they gave you back in 1998.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You was a little better.
<b>PT:</b> It was a little bit better.
<b>DR:</b> But it got worse?
<b>PT:</b> No, it's gotten about the same thing.  As a matter of fact, I think it's gotten a little bit better. 'Cause I wasn't able to sleep.  She wouldn't, the voices wouldn't leave me alone.  I could hear them in my ear.  I could hear them in my mind, and always telling me what to do, what not to do, and I don't, I don't have that as often, and I keep forgetting, I forget, you know, I might start doing something, and then I completely forget what I'm doing.  And with the Seroquel, it's gotten a little bit better.  It's, uh, I could remember, remember stuff more than when I was off the Seroquel.  So I would say it's, it's helped, not a hundred percent, but it does help quite a bit. 
<b>DR:</b> So then before you moved from Florida in 1998 when they gave you, you've always been on Seroquel and nothing else -
<b>PT:</b> I was - 
<b>DR:</b> Until I gave you Invega, right?
<b>PT:</b> I was, no, I was on different, the doctor had tried different medication, but I can't remember what name they were.  Um, the medication didn't help me at all, so he took me off it.
<b>DR:</b> We still have not received, did you sign the release because I need to get that release so I can see what has been tried.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I did sign the release.
<b>DR:</b> Did you give them the address for your doctor who was seeing you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> I haven't received anything.
<b>PT:</b> They didn't send anything?  I called them and, and asked them and they said that you all got to fax it to them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm sure they did.  We'll just check again and see what it is.  Just want to try and see what, I don't want to give the same thing they have tried and then we waste your time, you know, what I mean.  It's not worth it to go over the same medicines they tried and didn't work, so what good it is, you know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you, we continue with your Seroquel.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because your insurance doesn't give you 90 of the 300mg, I'm going to give you 60 of the 800mg, I mean 400mg.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, you can take, continue taking 2.  We'll discontinue Invega.  We'll continue with Zoloft, and I'm going to give you a medicine called Trilafon.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It is also for the voices.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll go with that and see if that helps.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You know.  Meantime, if we get the records from them, we'll just review them and see what happens.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, sounds good, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> And what about the dizziness and all that you were complaining about in the morning last time?  Is it any better?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I get, no, it's about the same.  I get, uh, it comes and goes.  So, it's really hard, it's really hard to say if it's gotten better.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I, I haven't been, I haven't been, I would say haven't, I haven't been, uh, where I get that dizzy feeling and I can't see nothing around me.  That seemed to have gone away.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good.
<b>PT:</b> But pretty much my situation is about the same.
<b>DR:</b> You're still living with your nephew?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> How are things okay at home with him?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, things is okay with him.  I, I, I sometimes hear voices when I'm watching TV at home.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I could hear voices.  Some calling my name, and sometimes I get confused.  I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what, what just happened.  You know, it's kind of hard for me to believe what had just happened, but if not, me and him is getting along real good, and he helps me with the bills.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> He works?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he works.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, I need to write you a prescription for your medicine everything, all right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Didn't give you any refill last time, so I'm going to go ahead write everything.
<b>PT:</b> I do - 
<b>DR:</b> I want to see you -
<b>PT:</b> I do have a refill.
<b>DR:</b> How did this happen?
<b>PT:</b> On the Zoloft.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, Zoloft you have, yes, but the Seroquel we change your strength - 
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So I have to write separate prescription for that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then I'm going to give you this new medicine.  It, it's really an old, old, old medicine, but it works.  So, let's try that and see if that helps.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, that's fine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and it's 4mg and you take 1 in the morning and 1 at night.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> If it makes you sleepy during the daytime, then take the 1 in the morning, 1 around 7 or 8 o'clock and the other one try it with your Seroquel, and let's see if you can control these voices or whatever is going on with you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I did mention that I got a, you got to call in the 400.  They won't fill it unless you call it in.
<b>DR:</b> I'll take care of it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
