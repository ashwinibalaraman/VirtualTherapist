Anonymous


<b>The article that begins below is
the third in a series of personal accounts
to be published in the</b>
<i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>. <b>We hope
that mental health professionals—the</b>
<i>Bulletin's</i> <b>primary
audience—will take this opportunity
to learn about the issues and
difficulties confronted by consumers
of mental health care. In
addition, we hope that these accounts
will give patients and
families a better sense of not
being alone in confronting the
problems that can be anticipated
by persons with serious emotional
difficulties. Although there are a
number of books and articles describing
the personal experiences
of patients and families with
mental disorder, we believe there
is a continuing need for experiences
to be shared among mental
health professionals, families, and
current and former patients.</b>


<b>We welcome other contributions
from patients, ex-patients, or
family members. Our major editorial
requirement is that such contributions
be clearly written and
organized and that a novel or
unique aspect of schizophrenia be
described, with special emphasis
on points that will be important
for professionals. Clinicians who
see articulate patients, with experiences
they believe should be
shared, might encourage these
patients to submit their articles to

Living with schizophrenia creates
problems for me that are not obvious
or easy to explain. I am not
entirely comfortable with the label
"schizophrenia" because it implies
that I am different in some basic
way from other people, when I feel
I am not. The label has helped me,
though, to feel less guilt about my
inability to "conquer" my problems,
and to learn to make some
allowances for my difficulties in
handling situations. Unfortunately,
other people often do not
recognize the difficulties I face or
make any attempt to make allowances
for me.


The largest problem I face—I
think the basic one—is the intensity
and variety of my feelings, and
my low threshold for handling
other people's intense feelings,
especially negative ones. I have
quite often experienced a euphoric
"high" that is much like being in
contact with some greater reality
or meaning to life—accompanied
by a kind of added brightness or
extra dimension to everyday things
around me. The other side of the
coin, though, is a very intense
anxiety from nowhere that typically
hits me quite suddenly after a
short period of time without medication.
The two feelings are opposite,
yet somehow connected.


Feelings are "the stuff life is
made of," and I do not regret a lot
of what I have experienced, but
the terrible feelings are bad
enough to make me opt for the
medication—
at least an adequate
amount to give me control, even
with some remaining discomfort. I
have been taking one of the
phenothiazines for almost 7 years,
and I am concerned about the
many potential problems with
long-term use, particularly tardive
dyskinesia. However, I feel there
is no effective alternative to the
drug, particularly if I am to maintain
my normal lifestyle, with a
husband and 9-year-old son.


My son—our son—is a very
healthy, active boy, with a "take
things in stride" disposition and

I am convinced that when I
make the effort I can be quite an
effective person, and I am good at
disguising the difficulty I often
have in picking up what people
say, especially if I am distracted by
something. I have typically at
times been overzealous about expressing
my point of view or feelings
about things, and suffered
later, regretting much that I have
said. But often what I do say is appreciated
by other people, and is
quite appropriate to what is being
discussed.


Problems with my normal
"facade" arise mainly when other
people expect me to become emotionally
involved with them. I find
emotions tremendously complex,
and I am quite acutely aware of the
many over— and undertones of
things people say and the way
they say them. Generally, I like direct,
honest, kind people, and I
have difficulty handling social
situations that require me to be artificial
or too careful.


Another problem I have to deal
with to a greater or lesser degree is
my "runaway thinking." I "free
associate" rather easily, and sometimes
forget what I was saying because
other ideas are in my mind.
If I concentrate, however, this can
be an advantage, because I have a
ready supply of new ideas—I
don't bore myself. Concentrating,
though, is sometimes easier said
than done.


Intimacy is an interesting problem
in my life. In a way, I am capable
of the deepest spiritual intimacy
with people, yet I am less
capable than most people of handling
the demands of relationships.
I cannot share negative
feelings other people have, because
I am too sensitive to them;
yet I can give a great deal of love
and concern when I am protected
against feelings like anger and
cynicism.


I used to think a great deal about
unlikely, unreal things, like being
watched or filmed and events
being orchestrated around me by
other people or outside forces, or
being literally an alien, since I felt
so different and basically unattached
to the world. I still have
similar feelings and thoughts, but
less so than before. In any case,
they come and go and don't affect
me greatly. The only pervading
feeling that is a problem sometimes—on
too little medication—is
a general one of unreality and
being unattached. The particular
ideas that stem from the feeling are
not the problem for me.


Overall, I feel I have a good life,
and I am, in spite of my frequent
doubts, a success in many areas. I
have good people as friends, and a
fine family, and I am not forced
into a position of taking on too
much independence or of being
too dependent. I am a unique and
interesting person; I don't always
quite fit in with the world, but I
think I add something to it.
