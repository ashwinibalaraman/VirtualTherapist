# VirtualTherapist

This is an app that allows users to sign up or login. 
When the user signs up he is provided with a slack channel with the slack api to chat with a virtual therapist.
The app also features a quiz to measure psychosis based on latent semantic analysis of word associations.

The app is deployed on cloud:
